# 2.97
Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function with
the following prototype:
/* Compute (float) i */
float_bits float_i2f(int i);
For argument i, this function computes the bit-level representation of
(float) i.
Test your function by evaluating it for all 2 32 values of argument f and com-
paring the result to what would be obtained using your machineâ€™s floating-point
operations.
