The files in the various subdirectories are source code from the
book "An Introduction to Parallel Programming, 2nd ed" by Peter 
Pacheco and Matthew Malensek, publisher Elsevier, Inc.

COMPILING
---------
Most of the programs are self-contained and should compile by
themselves provided you make sure that the compiler can find the
appropriate header files (e.g., mpi.h, pthread.h, semaphore.h,
cuda.h, timer.h) and libraries.  Documentation at the beginning of 
each program provides a sample command line for compilation on a 
typical Linux or MacOS X system.

RUNNING
-------
The exact syntax for starting the programs may be system dependent.
See your local expert for details.  Any input needed by the program
can be determined from comments at the beginning of the source
file.

I/O
---
Except for the CUDA programs all of the longer applications only use 
process/thread 0 for I/O.  The longer CUDA programs only use the 
host code for I/O.  However, except for the CUDA programs some short 
test programs (e.g., hello, world) print data from processes or 
threads other than 0.  Shorter CUDA programs may print from the 
CUDA threads.  Also in many of the programs, if a DEBUG macro is
defined, the program may print data from more than one process/thread.

DISCLAIMER
----------
These programs are not production quality.  Their main purpose is
to help the reader explore parallel programming.  They should be
easy to modify for a specific application and you are welcome to
do so.  If you have suggestions or discover any bugs it would be
greatly appreciated if you could let us know by sending email to
mmalensek at usfca dot edu.
